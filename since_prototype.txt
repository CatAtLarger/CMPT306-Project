Since the prototype we have added:

    Jonah:
        - made UI visually consistent and easy to read (fonts, colours, background, positions, etc.)
        - made all image elements more visually consistent and pixelated
        - fixed satellite drag and drop so it is more intuitive
        - added new sound effects and particle effects
        - created high score functions that write to a file
        - created the functions to check for game over
        - created UI elements:
            - Up Next UI
            - High Score and New High Score UI
            - Score Values UI
            - Satellite (ball drop) UI
        - general game adjustments based on feedback (size of balls, time to drop, etc.)
        - general organization and basic optimizations
        - worked on submission including itch page
        - gathered all beta-testing feedback
