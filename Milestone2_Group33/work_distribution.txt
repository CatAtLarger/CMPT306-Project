Khubaib:

Implemented satellite node as the primary dropper mechanism for the balls.

Added drag-and-drop functionality to allow the satellite to move within a circular radius with mouse.

Configured cooldowns to control the dropping rate of the balls.

Integrated a scoring system based on ball types, because each ball has a metadata value for accurate scorekeeping.

Set up score updates for each ball dropped and combined, following the metadata values.

Set up some UI with a score label and configured the ScoreTracker as a global autoload to track the player's points.

Created the Image that shows how many points each ball would grant and the size diffrences of each ball.
