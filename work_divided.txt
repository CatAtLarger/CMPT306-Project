Prototype Phase:

Implemented satellite node as the primary dropper mechanism for the balls.

Added drag-and-drop functionality to allow the satellite to move within a circular radius with mouse.

Configured cooldowns to control the dropping rate of the balls.

Integrated a scoring system based on ball types, because each ball has a metadata value for accurate scorekeeping.

Set up score updates for each ball dropped and combined, following the metadata values.

Set up some UI with a score label and configured the ScoreTracker as a global autoload to track the player's points.

Created the Image that shows how many points each ball would grant and the size diffrences of each ball.
-Recorded game video

Post-Prototype Work:

-Helped Jonah on showing what is being dropped:
    -Fixed the script to show what is being dropped so it shows what wil be dropped properly

- Work on the "Next Up" Feature:
    - Integrated a fully functional "Next Up" preview system to show the next three balls that will drop after the current ball.
    - Dynamically update the preview for the "Next Up" UI to shift when a ball is dropped.
    - Made the Next Up easily readable and understandable for the players.

- Created the Game Over Menu:
    - Designed buttons for "Play Again" and "Exit" with fully functional signals.
    - Updated Game Over Menu to dynamically display the final score.
    - Connect the GameOver Menu to i thibk the orbit script, so that it it basically freezes the game and brings up the game over menu.
